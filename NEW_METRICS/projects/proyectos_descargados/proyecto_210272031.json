If you manage to win, this means you have successfully cleared the area of buildings and planted trees in their place to save the world from global weirding. Global weirding is a term used to describe how, with global warming, we will see more extreme weather events: Avoid the term “global warming” because while that is what actually happens as global temperatures rise and the climate changes, also the weather gets weird. Global weirding is an issue that many people are trying to resolve in our world today. There are many ways in your everyday life we can prevent it. For example, you can reduce your carbon footprint by turning off the lights when leaving a room, recycling, using carpools, using renewable energy sources (solar power), using environmentally friendly transportation (scooters,electric cars, bikes, etc) There are so many ways you can get involved to help combat global weirding, whether it's a small deed like recycling or a big deed like re-arranging your entire diet so you eat little to no beef. Now go save the world!", 'instructions': 'To begin click the green flag. You have ten seconds to click all of the buildings and lower the carbon dioxide levels and save the world from global weirding. Once ALL of the buildings are clicked and have turned into trees stop clicking and enjoy your victory!', 'visibility': 'visible', 'public': True, 'comments_allowed': True, 'is_published': True, 'author': {'id': 30944511, 'username': 'salvatorebrotherss', 'scratchteam': False, 'history': {'joined': '1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'}, 'profile': {'id': None, 'images': {'90x90': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/30944511_90x90.png?v=', '60x60': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/30944511_60x60.png?v=', '55x55': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/30944511_55x55.png?v=', '50x50': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/30944511_50x50.png?v=', '32x32': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/30944511_32x32.png?v='}}}, 'image': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/210272031_480x360.png', 'images': {'282x218': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/210272031_282x218.png?v=1522345439', '216x163': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/210272031_216x163.png?v=1522345439', '200x200': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/210272031_200x200.png?v=1522345439', '144x108': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/210272031_144x108.png?v=1522345439', '135x102': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/210272031_135x102.png?v=1522345439', '100x80': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/210272031_100x80.png?v=1522345439'}, 'history': {'created': '2018-03-15T16:46:22.000Z', 'modified': '2018-03-29T17:43:59.000Z', 'shared': '2018-03-26T18:22:12.000Z'}, 'stats': {'views': 12, 'loves': 0, 'favorites': 0, 'remixes': 0}, 'remix': {'parent': None, 'root': None}, 'project_token': '1720875549_87aed0d663486c7fba3c8b46fa722004661c0c85f13456f44924addeacee94ebffd2202ed2049ed6103263af797d9cf77ccbb867d64d00401de85b7891745311'}
