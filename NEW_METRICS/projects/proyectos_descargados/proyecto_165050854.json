{'id': 165050854, 'title': 'Save The Fish', 'description': "You must note that this game is a VERY simplistic representation of ocean acidification. Here, fish seem to be directly affected and killed by contact with carbon dioxide. However, this is not very accurate. Ocean acidification affects ocean animals who grow/create shells more directly than other animals. So, fish are (for the most part) not directly affected by carbon dioxide being absorbed into the ocean. But, for the purpose of this game, we used a fish to represent animals affected by ocean acidification. Also, take into consideration that animals who are affected DO NOT die because of direct contact with carbon dioxide, but are chemically affected by the ocean's changing levels of acidity.", 'instructions': "1. Watch the brief introduction at the beginning of the game, to get a simple idea of what this game represents.\n2. Carbon dioxide will enter the water. Your job is to click on these molecules and prevent them from touching the fish on the screen.\n3a. Once all of the fish are dead, or when the 'fish dead' meter reaches three, you will lose the game.\n3b. Once all carbon dioxide molecules are gone, and the ocean acidity levels go down, you will win the game.", 'visibility': 'visible', 'public': True, 'comments_allowed': True, 'is_published': True, 'author': {'id': 24283554, 'username': 'Evergreen4h', 'scratchteam': False, 'history': {'joined': '1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'}, 'profile': {'id': None, 'images': {'90x90': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/24283554_90x90.png?v=', '60x60': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/24283554_60x60.png?v=', '55x55': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/24283554_55x55.png?v=', '50x50': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/24283554_50x50.png?v=', '32x32': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/24283554_32x32.png?v='}}}, 'image': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/165050854_480x360.png', 'images': {'282x218': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/165050854_282x218.png?v=1497579517', '216x163': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/165050854_216x163.png?v=1497579517', '200x200': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/165050854_200x200.png?v=1497579517', '144x108': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/165050854_144x108.png?v=1497579517', '135x102': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/165050854_135x102.png?v=1497579517', '100x80': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/165050854_100x80.png?v=1497579517'}, 'history': {'created': '2017-06-07T14:19:12.000Z', 'modified': '2017-06-16T02:18:37.000Z', 'shared': '2017-06-16T02:18:37.000Z'}, 'stats': {'views': 25, 'loves': 1, 'favorites': 0, 'remixes': 0}, 'remix': {'parent': None, 'root': None}, 'project_token': '1720875528_eec7d43a45b4d336336e9651abeefe57ab382010fa50dc00ba6e5d4041b979682d67ca5e7ba51a9d7fe121e6ae2f48b751b38c068fa6c2b8ba457aef45f22796'}
