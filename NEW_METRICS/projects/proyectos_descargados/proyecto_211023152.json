{'id': 211023152, 'title': 'Super Carbon Bros', 'description': 'This game involves a battle between carbon factoring and carbon decreasing elements, so be aware to which is which. These factor into the carbon cycle because with the every day pollution\'s and methane, carbon is quickly growing in the atmosphere and there are not enough "characters" or really helping components to help such as trees. However by using your inputs of reducing the amount of meat you eat and putting less harm into using electronics and cars we can make a difference.', 'instructions': 'The game will start out with character choosing slides. On the first slide is player one, the player which emits carbon into the atmosphere, This is player uses keys (W,A,S,and D to move up down left and right) For your "somewhat special" move use the button E and that will make your opponents points go down. In order for your opponents points to actually go down you must be touching the other player while clicking the E button.\nOn the other hand player two uses the controls ( left, right, up and down to move around and the space bar for the special move) Your character is one who does not add carbon into the atmosphere and who takes it out.\nYour character and back round will be randomly chosen so all you have to do is press next to move on.
