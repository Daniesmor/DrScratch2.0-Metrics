Your goal is to keep buying trees and protecting them by clicking on the deforestation characters. In order to buy trees, you need enough points. If you have enough points you click on the tree and drag  it into the available space for it to be planted (placed). There is a certain time limit of 2 minutes. If the timer reaches 0 you lose. Also, if the Co2 level reaches 25, you lose as well. However, if the Co2 level reaches 0 then you win. Some things to know are each tree reduces the amount of Co2 in the atmosphere by 2. Another thing is the Co2 increases by 1 gradually. Also, when a tree is destroyed the Co2 goes back up 1. And finally, you earn points to buy trees by clicking on the deforestation vehicles/lumberjack.', 'visibility': 'visible', 'public': True, 'comments_allowed': True, 'is_published': True, 'author': {'id': 31264059, 'username': 'XxDTAJxX', 'scratchteam': False, 'history': {'joined': '1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'}, 'profile': {'id': None, 'images': {'90x90': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/31264059_90x90.png?v=', '60x60': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/31264059_60x60.png?v=', '55x55': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/31264059_55x55.png?v=', '50x50': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/31264059_50x50.png?v=', '32x32': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/31264059_32x32.png?v='}}}, 'image': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/215466659_480x360.png', 'images': {'282x218': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/215466659_282x218.png?v=1525293162', '216x163': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/215466659_216x163.png?v=1525293162', '200x200': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/215466659_200x200.png?v=1525293162', '144x108': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/215466659_144x108.png?v=1525293162', '135x102': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/215466659_135x102.png?v=1525293162', '100x80': 'https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/215466659_100x80.png?v=1525293162'}, 'history': {'created': '2018-04-11T13:17:33.000Z', 'modified': '2018-05-02T20:32:42.000Z', 'shared': '2018-04-11T13:20:10.000Z'}, 'stats': {'views': 17, 'loves': 0, 'favorites': 0, 'remixes': 1}, 'remix': {'parent': None, 'root': None}, 'project_token': '1720875569_dea271e1f52f71e04700a525e28acbeb19176d644bf4396f4849d38b9d3da32bf62388940d9172300a97baa66fcf020e6b599f9c6363cde30e6c264fdbe05440'}
