{'id': 129181598, 'title': 'The Carbon Challenge', 'description': 'In the real world, people are clearing out millions of trees that help absorb carbon from the air. This process of cutting down trees is called deforestation. During this, the carbon absorbed by the trees is released into the atmosphere. Also, humans burning fossil fuels like gas (from the car in our game) pollutes the air. In this game the tree goes around absorbing carbon emitted by the car from the atmosphere. Also we want to thank Mrs. Adamson and Eli', 'instructions': "-You are a tree. To move use the arrow keys. Try to make it to the end of the maze (the red line) and beat the best time. Comment if you get it. Touch all of the carbon blocks to turn them into trees. When the trees are created, some pollution from the car will go away and the maze will be opened up.  DON'T get deforested by the the axe men or else.  Remember to love this project and make it your favorite or remix.
